# Flip to Shhh

### Purpose

Imagine you are having a good conversation with a friend, but suddenly you begin to get a overwhelming number of notification from your phone. Naturally, you'd further disturb the conversation's flow by opening your phone and silencing it, but this app helps resolve the disturbance caused to your conversation from your phone's notification and the inability to quickly and conveniently silence your phone.

### How-to use
 
Simply install the apk file, and make sure to enable the following permissions

- Enable notifications permission - As of the latest android version this, an app is required to have a notification present when running in the background, so by enabling this permission the app works even when fully closed
- Enable physical activity permission - Allows the service to detect when the phone is faced down
- From "Special Access" of android settings, enable "Do not disturb permission" for the "Flip to Shhh" app - This is required for changing between ringer modes

**For now, these permissions must be enabled manually to make the app work. Soon I will release a version where the permissions are handled in a more user-friendly way**

My github releases page will include future app versions: [Github releases](https://github.com/GoldRift/Flip-to-Shhh/releases/tag/latest)

After this, you must toggle on the button in the main screen, this will run the service in the background, now you may close the app, it will detect when your phone is faced down and proceed to silence your phone. Additionally, you will be able to further customize the app by pressing the settings icon, you can currently change options like the ringer mode the app goes into when faced down. The app defaults to silence mode, although you can change to vibrate mode, where notifications are not fully silenced, instead, it will vibrate.
